			<h2>Favourite Quotes: </h2>	
				<blockquote>	
				  <em>Run from what's comfortable. <br>Forget safety.  <br>Live where you fear to live.  <br>Destroy your reputation. Be notorious. <br> I have tried prudent planning long enough.  <br> From now on I'll be mad. </em> <br><br><b>- Rumi</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumi">[Click here to learn about Rumi]</a>

				<blockquote>
				  <em>In the midst of winter, I found there was,  <br>within me, an invincible summer.  <br>And that makes me happy. <br> For it says that no matter how hard <br> the world pushes against me, <br> within me, there's something stronger, <br> something better, pushing right back. </em> <br> <br><b> - Albert Camus</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus">[Click here to learn about Albert Camus]</a>
