		<h1>Important Concepts:</h1>
		<p>The following are notes on important concepts from Lesson  1.</p>
		
		<h3>General Notes On Learning:</h3>
		<p> 
		Almost anyone can learn anything. Brains are very similar and flexible - given the right inputs, (almost) anyone can learn web development / computer programming.
		<br> 
		<br>		
		- Be self motivated. <br>
		- Learning is challenging, study consistently. <br> 
		- Make a schedule. Give it >1hr/day if possible. <br>
		- Seek out answers on your own. <br>
		- Ask questions. <br> <br>
		</p>
		
		<h3>What Is The Internet?</h3>
		<p> 
		- The internet is a collection of HTML documents. <br>  
		- It was invented in the early 1990s. <br>
		- It has about 30 billion webpages. <br>
		</p>
	
		<h3>How The Internet Works:</h3>
		<p> 
		The internet works by facilitating communication between different computers that are linked together. Essentially when a person uses a browser to request stuff on the internet, here is what happens: 
		<br>
		<br>
		- The <strong >browser</strong> sends a <strong>HTTP</strong>[1] request to a server via the internet. <br>
		- The <strong>server</strong>[2] responds to the request and it is relayed back to the browser.<br>
		- The browser interprets the information sent back and displays it to the user. 
		<br> 
		<h4>Definitions: </h4>
		[1] <strong>HTTP</strong>: stands for <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em>. It is a simple protocol that the browser uses for communicating with the servers. 
		<br>
		<br>
		[2] <strong>Servers</strong>: are computers that are optimized for hosting files / storing information as opposed to being a computer for personal use. 
		<br>

		This video that I found on youtube does a good job of explaining how the internet works as well:

		If you prefer to read though, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm"> this webpage</a> does a great job of explaining the nuances of how the internet works as well :) 
		<br>
		</p>
		
		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<p> 
		HTML stands for <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>. It is the building block of the web. It contains text (stuff you see), markup (that tells the browser how to display stuff), references to other documents, images, videos, etc. and links to other webpages. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>HTML Tags And Elements</h3>
		<p> 
		<strong>Tags</strong> in a HTML document are what we use to tell the browser how to display the contents that are affected by that particular tag. Most tags have two parts: an opening tag and a closing tag. Tags that don't have any contents and hence don't need a closing tag are called <em><b>void tags.</b></em>
		<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Elements</strong> are what make up a HTML document. Tags and and the contents in between them (opening and closing tag), together, make up an element. The browser can identify the type of an element by looking at the tags.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>HTML Attributes</strong>: some elements have additional values / information that provide the browser additional context. Attributes are contained in the opening tags of the elements. An example of one such attribute is the image tag that takes an attribute called <em>alt</em> that can give visually impaired users a description of the image. 
		<br>
		
		<br>
		<strong>Inline vs Block Elements</strong>: inline elements end a line whereas block elements make an invisible box around the text/contents and can have user defined height and width.<br>

		<br>
		<strong>Container Elements</strong> do nothing but contain stuff inside themselves. They aid in creating web pages with complex structures.<br>
		<br>
		</p>
		
		<h3>Notes from lesson 2: HTML/CSS/DOM/JS</h3>
		<p> 
		- HTMl files are like the structures of the house. <br>  
		- CSS is the styling - color, decoration, etc. <br>
		- JS - interactive components <br>
		</p>
		DOM - Document Object Model - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.
		<br><br>
		A tree structure or tree diagram is a way of representing the hierarchical nature of a structure in a graphical form. It is named a "tree structure" because the classic representation resembles a tree, even though the chart is generally upside down compared to an actual tree, with the "root" at the top and the "leaves" at the bottom.
